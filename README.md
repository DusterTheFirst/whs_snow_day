# whs_urgent_alerts
> A utility to provide push notifications about the urgent alerts posted on the
Wellesley High School's website

## Usage

## How It Works

## Developing
`whs_urgent_alerts` is built with [rust](https://rust-lang.org) and uses rust's package
manager cargo. To download the latest version of rust and cargo for local development, we
suggest using [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

**With cargo:**
- `cargo run` can be used to start the program
- `cargo test` can be used to run unit tests
